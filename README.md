## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- One user challenges another using `/duel`.
- Both users are assigned roles: **Dropper** or **Checker**.
- Each privately chooses a number from 1 to 60 via DM.
- The winner is determined by comparing numbers:
  - Checker wins if their number is higher.
  - Dropper wins if their number is higher.
  - A tie if both choose the same number.
- Points are added/subtracted based on outcomes and stored in `scores.json`.
